# SAFEGUARD LLM Markdown Responses Archive

A curated archive of Large Language Model (LLM) prompts and responses for the SAFEGUARD project. This repository stores research notes, design drafts, onboarding scripts, and implementation documents as Markdown files (no application code).

Last updated: 2025-09-16

## Overview
This repo contains standalone Markdown documents produced during exploration and development of components around the SAFEGUARD initiative (e.g., IASMS integration, simulation docs, onboarding flows, plugin systems, RAG experiments). Files follow a naming convention that groups queries and LLM outputs by topic and iteration, for example:

- _LLM44-3dIASMS.md, _LLM44-3dIASMS-try2.md — 3D simulation and IASMS integration notes
- _Query35-sim.md — a related question or task prompt
- _LLM26.md, _LLM24.md — packaging and onboarding tooling notes

There is no compiled/runtime application in this repository; it is a documentation/content archive.

## Detected Stack
- Primary language: Markdown (.md)
- Frameworks: none in repo
- Package manager: none detected (no package.json, requirements.txt, or lock files present)
- Entry points/binaries: none
- Scripts: none

Notes:
- Several Markdown files include example code snippets (Node.js, shell, PowerShell, etc.) for illustration. These are not runnable within this repository as-is.

## Project Structure
Top-level files (abbreviated):
- README.md — this file
- _LLM*.md — LLM outputs, specs, design notes (e.g., _LLM44-3dIASMS-try2.md)
- _Query*.md — prompts/tasks/questions associated with an LLM response

Examples from this repo:
- _LLM44-3dIASMS-try2.md — comprehensive 3D simulation + IASMS integration doc (HTML-heavy)
- _LLM42-docs.md, _Query42-docs.md — documentation planning
- _LLM26.md, _LLM24.md — packaging/onboarding tool scripts and notes
- _LLM18-RAG.md — RAG experiments

The directory intentionally remains flat to make ad-hoc documents easy to find by prefix.

## Contributing
- Keep filenames consistent with existing patterns: prefix with _LLM or _Query, include a short topic, and optional iteration suffixes like -try2.
- Prefer self-contained Markdown with clear headings.
- If adding runnable code or dependencies, consider placing them in a separate repository or a dedicated subdirectory with its own README.

## License
TODO: Add license. If this repository should be open-source, include a LICENSE file (e.g., MIT/Apache-2.0). If proprietary, add a notice stating usage restrictions.

## Related/Next Steps (Optional)
- TODO: Decide on organizing these docs into a published site (e.g., GitHub Pages + MkDocs).
- TODO: Add an index/TOC Markdown file that links major documents by topic area.
- TODO: If certain documents become canonical specs, promote them to a dedicated repo with tests and CI.
