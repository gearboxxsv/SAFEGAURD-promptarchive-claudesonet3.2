Let’s consider the monitoring features and observations from the monitoring. We need to innovate a dashboard using the d3.js library. Here are some resources to help you get started:

- https://github.com/d3/d3/blob/main/docs/getting-started.md
- https://github.com/d3/d3.git
- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/learning-zone/d3js-chart-basics/refs/heads/master/d3-functions-list.md
- https://github.com/d3/d3.git

Think about the web app static routes that would be ideal to feed a dashboard. Use dials, graphics, histograms, and other representations for the monitoring datasets. Innovate and create a pioneering dashboard, perhaps a three.js component to display the decentralized network’s geographic location or in a node diagram similar to the logo.

Plan to work on a single webpage that uses emit or HTML5 sockets. If the webpage fails, fall back to HTTP/2 JSON polling with keep-alive HTTP to ensure the dashboard’s reliability. Additionally, the tool should be mobile-ready and desktop-friendly. Consider using a custom CSS template to format the user experience.

Work hard, innovate, and once the dashboard HTML is completed, set up a server web app class and server to provide datasets and interactivity for the dashboard. Write a documentation page for the dashboard, located at /docs/monitoring/dashboardhowto.html, to provide help and guidance. Finally, update the /docs/index.html page with the new navigation.
