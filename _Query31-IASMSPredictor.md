________ SECOND QUERY

We need to create the IASMS prediction toolset now.
Continue finishing the code and plan so you will leverage all the recent addtions for IASMS code, then stop to fully consider the predictive models and functions used in the codebase for all modalities, how can these be applied to IASMS code?  Develop at least 10 predictive ML or other use cases, plan the code implementation, write the code per the existing project requirements.  Make sure to not skip implementation of any aspect of the code.  For instance you put ‘// TODO: Implement’, this is not accept as a solution, be creative and pioneering to create cutting edge solutions that fully code the following:

Battery Health/Performance
Narrative:
A passenger in a UAM vehicle departed a vertiport in a densely populated urban city with a flight plan to the airport. The flight, estimated at 15 minutes, takes a route through high-rise buildings, suburban housing, industrial facilities, and a large river with bridges. During the midpoint cruise, the IASMS battery health service reported overheating and estimated 5 minutes of flight time.

Questions:

- What IASMS services are needed to ensure safe vehicle landing? Who’s affected, and where will the services be located? What’s graceful degradation in this context?

- A package delivery UAS autonomously delivers a 40-pound package across an urban city with high-rise buildings and people. The flight plan is approved and departs the distribution center without issues. However, during the journey, the vehicle loses all primary data-link connections with remote parties, including the operator control center, USS, and SDSPs.

- What IASMS services are needed for a lost link contingency plan? Who’s affected, and where will the services be located? What’s graceful degradation in this context?

- A passenger-carrying UAM takes off from a densely populated urban vertiport with other vehicles and pedestrians. The vehicle departs as scheduled within the UAM-inspired ATM system. After initial ascent, a critical system failure caused by bird strike damages one rotor/motor assembly, affecting flight performance and control. An immediate landing is required.

- What IASMS services provide maximum safety assurance? What other operations are affected? Where are the identified services located? What IASMS services could’ve prevented the bird strike? What data is needed to monitor, assess, and mitigate the incident’s impact?
  Risks of bird strike and their impact on nominal operation.

USS/U4-SS Service Disruption:

An unplanned disruption in one USS service results in data communications loss (e.g., SWIM/FIMS data feeds, power loss, air/ground link loss) affecting some U4-SS vehicles operating in urban airspace. Another USS in a partially overlapping area remains unaffected.

Questions:

How would an airspace operations management system allow for a graceful degradation of UAM operations due to unintended disruptions (e.g., GPS loss, flight services, CNSI, weather info, UAM Port issues, cyber security attacks)?

IASMS Use Case Capabilities: Time-Based Flow Management:

The UAM-inspired ATM system provides time-based flow management (TBFM) to safely minimize flight time and maximize vertiport throughput in UAM airspace under most weather conditions. TBFM requires all U4-SS vehicles to provide flight intent and position information during VLOS and BVLOS operations. Vehicles must be equipped for performance-based navigation (PBN) enabling trajectory-based operations (TBO). Congestion management involves sequencing and spacing arrivals to a vertiport for enroute vehicles and vehicles waiting for departure.

Questions:

What RNP accuracy is required for PBN in a UAM operational environment? Would a circle with a radius of 0.05 hundredth of a NM as RNP 0.05 be sufficient?

What IASMS services are required for TBFM? Where will they reside? What services are necessary for TBFM resilience?

- What data is required to monitor, assess, and mitigate the incident?
  Risks of bird strikes and their impact on nominal operation.
