IASMS services provide real-time information and data on vehicle state, known hazards, safety risks, and causal factors. These services correspond to the flight phase and vary based on risks, monitored data, and mitigation actions.

Entities listed in the section above can use these services in part or whole. Some definitions are from the UTM Concept of Operations [5].

Key IASMS Services

Three crucial service categories are essential for an effective IASMS: monitor, assess, and mitigate [6]. These align with the three functions of the IASMS concept described by the National Academies [3] and Nowinski [17].

To ensure vehicle, airspace, and NAS safety, several key IASMS capabilities are essential. Each capability provides a safety service that reduces the risk of an operation by providing timely feedback on the current state compared to the expected or nominal state. Monitoring multiple data sets and analyzing them generates critical assessments.
Hazards threatening operational safety are identified by ConOps. It provides a list of key service categories, essential for safe and scalable NAS transformation. These services are categorized into Monitor, Assessment, and Mitigation, forming an IASMS capability. Timeliness requirements depend on risk criticality and mitigation actions. IASMS capabilities vary based on information availability and characteristics. Considering time frames, three service types are defined for critical safety assurance needs: SDS-R, SDS-X, and SDS-S. SDS-R and SDS-X services address near-real-time capability requirements within seconds to minutes, while SDS-S services address system-wide capability requirements over hours to months. All three can function independently but are more effective with shared information. SDS-R services focus on vehicle health and safety, SDS-X services involve air traffic operations and airspace constraints, and SDS-S services include post-flight data analytics.

Fusion of data across multiple information classes offers innovative developments in enhanced scalability and efficiency for safety-related issues. For instance, a service capability integrating power health information, aircraft model data, and population density can generate a time- or distance-remaining metric and provide options for safely landing the aircraft with minimal harm to the vehicle and environment in case of an off-nominal event.
To ensure safety amidst increasing operations, IASMS service capabilities can communicate or include multiple information classes for informed risk mitigation.

Monitor Function and Data Services: Categories of Service Types

Predictive models for safety-critical risks can be used by these services. They can operate at varying update rates and data resolutions, accommodating user/operator requirements. They can be executed in real-time or near real-time on the vehicle, Ground Control Station, USS, or SDSP. These services include:

- Aircraft state information and aerodynamic models, including trajectory data, for flight performance (Reference: [18]).
- Positioning system state information and performance models, for location.
- Communications system state information, RFI models, and voice communication/human performance data, for communication. This involves monitoring uplink/downlink connectivity.
- Population density information and dynamics models, for proximity to people.
- Vehicle system health state information and models, including engine/battery health, communication, and navigation monitors, for airworthiness and remote flight safety decisions.
- Aeronautical Information Services (AIS), such as special use airspace and temporary flight, for navigation and safety.
  This service includes restrictions, weather conditions, and geographic data representing terrain, obstacles, and airport mapping features. It’s already available but needs a more timely update rate. However, it’s not yet tailored to low-altitude S-UAS urban operations. This addresses the question of adequate route structure.

Young et al. identified models beneficial to the envisioned IASMS capabilities described in the ISSA ConOps. These models included weather and battery performance models [19].

Predictive models and data, including synchronization and service interaction, may vary based on operational state (pre-flight, in-flight, post-flight). Surveillance data may be provided by the SDSP or USS depending on requirements.

The National Academies report proposed using IASMS data and large-scale data analytics to monitor systemic or anomalous changes to the NAS [3]. Data resources include system services like ADS-B, SWIM, FIMS, wireless links, ground networks, and aircraft-to-aircraft communications. Key factors for data collection and information class include:

- Availability of vehicle and system data, as well as performance models.
- Latency and accuracy of data from different sources, which can limit correlation and fusion.
- Update rates using synchronous and asynchronous timing between information classes.
- Integrity of data from NAS communications, navigation, and surveillance networks.
- Security issues unique to IASMS operation.
  Detection and mitigation techniques for cyber threats compromising NAS communications, navigation, and surveillance networks without developing more secure protocols or firewalls elsewhere are crucial.

Heterogeneous data formats consistent with data exchange standards are essential. Differences constrain data correlation, synthesis, timing, accuracy, and other characteristics.

Avionics standards are vital for collecting real-time data from aircraft to terrestrial or satellite-based systems, ground networks, and future aircraft-to-aircraft communications.

Implementation and service costs are crucial factors in the IASMS business case. Evaluating the proprietary nature of on-board systems and their high modification costs compared to the value of additional data is essential.

Spectrum regulation and bandwidth utilization are essential for sufficient data services considering update rates, latencies, and resolutions from multiple sources.

Understanding and tracking data sources and quality over time is crucial for IASMS reliability. Minimum Aviation System Performance Standards (MASPS) establish design criteria for safety-critical IASMS services. Some standards, like DO-364 and DO-200B, may exist and be referenced. However, additional MASPS and data standards are needed for complex systems’ growth. MASPS for safety are equally important.

Critical systems and locations vary by domain, like package delivery using sUAS or passenger carrying vehicles using UAM. Domain-specific MASPS may provide necessary design criteria and guidance. As NAS operations evolve, consider simple methods based on exceedance criteria to complex model-based, conformance-based, and statistical-based methods.

Safety data’s value proposition is crucial. Understand the value added by specific data based on its importance and cost of collection, which depends on availability. Developing an IASMS may be costly, delaying or impacting implementation. A phased implementation with the AAM community could overcome cost-benefit barriers.

To achieve IASMS goals, data fusion may require using existing and new sources, including ADS-B reports, controller-pilot voice communications, and flight crew members. Flight data and non-flight data, such as human performance measurements, can also be included.

The transition paths for UAM involve integrating multiple technologies and operational capabilities. A single USS could resemble an airline operations center, planning and coordinating multiple flights, including weather re-routing and traffic congestion. Large geographic areas may involve multiple USSs or multiple larger USSs for different business entities. Considering the area, sUAS may fly BVLOS, while air taxis may use eVTOL.

Autonomous vehicles may become commonplace, especially initially, in a mixed-equipment operational environment.

Now, let’s consider the files that help accomplish these goals. Can they improve operational outcomes or add pioneering features to safeguard? Then, plan the changes and provide a list of recommendations.

Next, convert these concepts to JavaScript by adding new plugins, core classes, or modifying the existing software code. Ensure copyright information is placed at the top of each page in comments, and the file name and full path are included in the page heading. Fully comment the code using JSDOC. Avoid skipping any aspect of the code, for instance ‘Do not skip implementation of any aspect of the C++ code.  For instance you put // TODO: Implement’ is not acceptable at any time in any code generated. Work hard, focus on the complete code or function, and ensure it functions well. For instance, if a function section requires implementation, thoroughly work on it and ensure it functions correctly.
