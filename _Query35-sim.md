the workflow from the prior chat did not complete.  it stopped on file '/server/iasms/modules/IasmsSimulationTrainingModule.js' Think very hard, have we covered all the use cases? Did you plan and code all the scenarios from the documentation? Think about it, examine the IASMS javascript files, plan if there are any additional items missing, create or update the files, put the name of the files in the header so we can replace them in the codebase. Take the time to fulfill all the goals of the IASMS system wide information management system by NASA. create more AR/VR features accross all the codebase - wow me
