there are issues with the react codebase, many of the includes are missing the libraries.  I need to make sure there is a setup shell script to build a react app that includes all the items for the AR/VR webXR meta and haptics toolsets.  create a script to build a meteor react application from bash, also make sure that the following directory includes from the solution in /client/simulator* files you created have libraries resolved by creating the code now or using the bash script to import sources from the web: colaboration
neural
collaborative
physics
controls
ui
data
visualization
environment
