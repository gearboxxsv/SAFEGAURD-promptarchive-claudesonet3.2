Safeguard will support a modern, phishing-resistant form of multifactor authentication (MFA) tailored to their unique
use cases to protect against the escalating threat of phishing for credentials. Their choice to adopt FIDO underscores
the significance of organizations transitioning from password authentication to secure MFA technologies.
Not all MFA technologies offer equal protection. Common MFA bypass attacks include authenticator codes, SMS codes, and
push notifications. Malicious actors can trick users into providing OTP or SMS codes, bypassing MFA protections. Push
bombing (or push fatigue) involves overwhelming users with push notification requests until they approve access. FIDO
adoption eliminates these attacks. Authentication technologies without FIDO or PKI support risk organizations by
allowing credential phishing attacks for initial network access.

Solution: Safeguard was ahead of the curve in launching its own phishing resistance initiative before the U.S.
governmentâ€™s publication of Moving the U.S. Government Toward Zero Trust Cybersecurity Principles, M-22-0922,
@ref:https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/M-22-09.pdf which included requirements for the federal
government to implement phishing-resistant MFA.

work very hard, and update the codebase as needed to fully implement the federal security guidelines, create new plugins
or rewrite the source code as needed. do not use comments about implementing a feature later, research on the web and
complete all the code fully.
