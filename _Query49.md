plan the work, then think hard if all is included.  tell me the plan, then take the time to review the /docs/index.html page to update links for new files you are going to create.  These files all share a common bootstrap4 design, common and linking, bookmarking of page elements.  then create any missing pages for the help system, ensure the filename with full path is located in the responses for my use in the assembly of the files, the filename you provide shall match the navigation.  continue until all is completed.
Complete the following files to start:

1. `/docs/monitoring/opentelemetry_integration.html` - Details on OpenTelemetry integration
2. `/docs/monitoring/performance_testing.html` - Documentation on performance testing
3. `/docs/monitoring/worker_management.html` - Information on worker thread management
4. `/docs/monitoring/dashboard_guide.html` - Guide to using the monitoring dashboards

Then, make the time to explore and complete documentation for the following.
1.
    - The WellKnownDiscoveryService is placed in `server/services/` directory along with other services
    - Helper utilities for plugins are placed in `server/utils/`
    - All routes are properly mounted at the path `/.well-known/`

2. **Well-Known Routes**:
    - - Main discovery endpoint listing all available services `/.well-known/`
    - - Server capabilities and information `/.well-known/server-info`
    - - Agent-to-Agent protocol details `/.well-known/agent-to-agent`
    - - Model Context Protocol details `/.well-known/mcp`
    - - Available plugins list `/.well-known/plugins`
    - `/.well-known/plugins/{pluginName}` - Specific plugin details
    - - All available protocols `/.well-known/protocols`

3. **Short URL Redirects**:
    - `/discovery` → `/.well-known/`
    - `/a2a-discovery` → `/.well-known/agent-to-agent`
    - `/mcp-discovery` → `/.well-known/mcp`
    - `/plugins-discovery` → `/.well-known/plugins`

4. **Plugin Integration**:
    - Plugins can register their own discovery endpoints
    - Plugins can publish their capabilities through the discovery service
    - Support for static .well-known files from `/private/.well-known/`

5. **JSON-RPC Methods**:
    - Added methods to query discovery information programmatically
    - Accessible through the HTTP/2 JSON-RPC server

This implementation offers a robust and future-proof solution for service discovery within the SAFEGUARD platform. It adheres to the widely recognized URL standard for service discovery across systems, facilitating the standardized publication of capabilities by all modules and plugins. The `.well-known` extension is utilized for this purpose.

Next, think hard and plan and carefully update the navigation and related content on the home page to reflect these changes. This involves creating a new `index.html` page that showcases the exciting new features and links.
