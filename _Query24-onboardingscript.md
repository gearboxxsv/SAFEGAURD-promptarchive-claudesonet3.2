Think hard and plan carefully about how plugin architecture Is designed, and plan an onboarding process that includes a pubic HTML page and a GIT repo setup README.md for the same kick-off overview and steps to add a plugin. You can use the /docs information to assist in content generation.  Create both files after the process is completed for the shell script design outlined below is done.

The plugin architecture offers a key benefit: the onboarding of Python and Node applications. It enables the creation of pioneering and secure tools that meet the following goals:

A plugin is developed by developers on their machines. We need a way to encapsulate the source code and related metadata, graphics, documentation, or other files into a user-friendly process. Thoroughly plan and research best practices from the internet. The website should clearly state, “Get started with onboarding a plugin today. Click here to copy this script.” Open a shell on your machine within the directory of your plugin, paste the script, and run it. This will initiate a wget or a similar process for Windows, pipe it to bash, and start the process. For Windows, assume the need for a separate script that will run in PowerShell and be compatible with Windows 10 or later.

These are the features:

The shell script will detect whether the user is using Windows, macOS, or Unix. Based on the operating system, it will implement the following workflow to complete a full setup of a module as a plugin.

The shell will be interactive, allowing users to navigate using arrow keys or text prompts.

The script will iterate through the directory to determine if the user is using Node.js or Python.

For each runtime implementation, the script will follow specific standards.

For Node.js, the script will look for a file named package.json.

For Python, the script will look for a file named requirements.txt or another file that lists the packages.

The script will prompt the user to confirm whether this is the configuration file they want to use. If not, the script will display the full directory tree, allowing users to select the configuration file using the arrow up and down keys. If the user hits return, the script will continue. The last item in the list will be exit, which will exit the program with a return value of 0.

Next, the script will parse the configuration file and create a list of dependencies.

If a Dockerfile exists, the script will parse it to learn how to build the Docker image using the OpenAPIWizardKubernetesDeployer.js or OCIContainerManager.js design pattern.

The script will then prompt the user to enter the contract terms and cost. The user can choose between one-time payments, subscription payments (for minutes, hours, days, or months), or payments in tokens or money. The script will use the conversion rate of $.01 = one token.

If no Dockerfile is present, the script will create a Dockerfile using the standard Node.js or Python build using a Debian or Ubuntu image. The user can choose which image to use.

The script will print a summary of the plugin configuration settings and ask the user to confirm whether they want to proceed. If the user confirms, the script will restart the wizard from the beginning.

It will also include copyright information on the starting screen.

If the user decides to build the config.json file, the script will print a success message.


Prompt summary for the setup script shall include:
"id": “$name-version“,

If a .git is in the directory use git get the build version or last commit version/date to create a version


"version": “1.0.0",

Ask the the user for the name of the plugin,
"name": "Cloudflare Tunnel Manager”,

ask the user for their company and a description that will  concatenate the ‘description’ value
“description":


ask the user for their company or name to concatenate the ‘name’ value
"author": "Autonomy Association International, Inc.",

What is the license type, [ proprietary to comany name, or put the top 4 open source license types in the list]
"license": "NASA Patent License",

Ask if there’s a copyright notice. If they provide one, include it here. Otherwise, use the default copyright notice: “Copyright 2025 Autonomy Association International Inc., all rights reserved.”

Enter the entry point for execution. For a node, it’s usually index.js. For Python, use the default python.py. If it doesn’t clear a select list and the arrow keys don’t work, ask if there’s an issue.
"entryPoint": "index.js",

As described above the contract will conform to the standards already in the codebase, complete with a nice set of questions to coform to the requirements of the plugin architecture.
"billing": {
"tokenCost": 0,
"freeQuota": {
"enabled": true,
"limit": "unlimited"
},

Any other config.json will be standard and list the standard plug json objectsL

dependencies": [],
"configuration":
“api”:[{methods:[], events:[]}]

Thank hard to make this setup wizard amazing and fun to use:
A storefront will display the name, description, contract terms, and related details on the list of API offerings. A user interface object can include an image directly in the listing. This image is selected from a directory list of the image directory. If the image directory is not found, the offer can be made to create it and set the file to be named “logo.png.” Alternatively, the user can choose to exit the script and place the graphic in the file. The icon should be icon-sized, not larger than 100x100 pixels. It can be in PNG, SVG, or JPG file type and extension.

The category will conform to to the current list of categories:
Artificial Intelligence (AI)
Machine Learning (ML): Algorithms that enable systems to learn from data and improve over time.
Deep Learning: A subset of ML using neural networks with multiple layers for complex data processing.

Finally, the default background color for the logo div tag should be expressed in HEX. Alternatively, the user should have the option to choose from a list of predefined color options and map them to their corresponding HEX values for use in the config.json file. If the user doesn’t provide a color, a default color should be chosen from the list.
