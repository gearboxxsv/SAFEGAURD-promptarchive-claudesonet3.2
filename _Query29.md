Only spacemission modality is built, leaving geospatial and other modalities unaddressed. This is not complete.
Carefully examine the code to ensure all modalities are accounted for. Should these be implemented in C++? We need a
Makefile to build the C++ and related code in the Python codebase to import the C++ library. The C++ library must be
executable on Linux Ubuntu, Debian, AMD64 chipsets, Darwin OS, Apple M3 chipsets, Raspberry Pi, and Mini Pi hardware,
and all operating systems. This is not complete. Work HARD - Take the time to plan and complete the request. Once
completed, update the index.html to provide instructions on installing the C++ library or using it, and the readme for
staff with instructions on using Make, GCC requirements, and any updates or new Bash scripts.
Do not skip implementation of any aspect of the C++ code. For instance you put // TODO: Implement more sophisticated
license verification where I expected a license validation scheme and related to this there should be a shell script
that builds a license key. No more comments or do it later - do it now and do it right please. Work harder, take the
time, fully completed the task.
