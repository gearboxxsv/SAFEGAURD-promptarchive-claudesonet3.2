look at the modalities of the system.  we have sea, space, land, subsurface, people, streets, sidewalk robots and all need to simulate activity to demonstrate the amazing codebase and features of the software. what else can use do with AR/VR using three.js? work hard to make other modalities AR/VR ready.

part 2

nice work, start thinking about more immersive and wow factor uses.  three.js ,webXR, meta headsets... go wild and innovate.  plan, spend the time to think it all over, tell me the plan, then build the code.  do not put comments about 'implementation' or not completely writing the software.  spend time and think hard to fully complete the codebase
