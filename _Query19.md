Work diligently to consider the Nginx setup process, as it requires a cloudflared tunnel connection per the zero trust specification @ref:https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-207.pdf @ref:https://dodcio.defense.gov/Portals/0/Documents/Library/DoD-ZTStrategy.pdf @ref:https://media.defense.gov/2021/Feb/25/2002588479/-1/-1/0/CSI_EMBRACING_ZT_SECURITY_MODEL_UOO115131-21.PDF
Safeguard will support a modern, phishing-resistant form of multifactor authentication (MFA) tailored to their unique use cases to protect against the escalating threat of phishing for credentials. Their choice to adopt FIDO underscores the significance of organizations transitioning from password authentication to secure MFA technologies.
Not all MFA technologies offer equal protection. Common MFA bypass attacks include authenticator codes, SMS codes, and push notifications. Malicious actors can trick users into providing OTP or SMS codes, bypassing MFA protections. Push bombing (or push fatigue) involves overwhelming users with push notification requests until they approve access. FIDO adoption eliminates these attacks. Authentication technologies without FIDO or PKI support risk organizations by allowing credential phishing attacks for initial network access. @ref:https://www.cio.gov/assets/files/Zero-Trust-DataSecurityGuide_RevisedMay2025_CIO.govVersion.pdf
Solution: Safeguard was ahead of the curve in launching its own phishing resistance initiative before the U.S. government’s publication of Moving the U.S. Government Toward Zero Trust Cybersecurity Principles, M-22-0922, @ref:https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/M-22-09.pdf which included requirements for the federal government to implement phishing-resistant MFA.



Plugin architecture should support HTTP or HTTPS. Core APIs and plugins must announce their location using Cloudflare, indicating the core service’s running location. Cloudflare should route traffic from the ingress to the core service using HTTP or HTTPS. When the core service shuts down, Cloudflare should clean up the route, notify peers and superiors, and manage the zero trust setup and shutdown processes through the Cloudflare API.

Plan carefully and innovate with pioneering code to implement the following goals:

- When a core or supercore comes up, there’s an onboarding process. If it’s a supercore, it adds a TXT record to the DNS of the installation using Cloudflare DNS. So, the startup environment must contain the Cloudflare authentication and key to access the domain name configuration.

- When the system is fully running, the first thing a core will do is check the DNS for a TXT record called _supercore. If no _supercore exists, it will promote itself to a supercore, register its DNS using the Zerotrust Cloudflare methodology, and then add itself as a DNS entry for SSH, HTTPS, HTTP, and so on. Once the DNS record is active, it will then add the TXT record with its name resolution URL.

- There can be many supercore instances. Normally, there are three, but it’s up to the customer to decide that count using an environment variable. Core and supercore may act as compute, storage, network relay, and host configuration information. A TXT record will be managed with _core as the name for each core. When an instance comes up, it will contact the DNS using standard resolution methods for the _core TXT records of the environment ROOTDOMAIN variable as its seed for starting up DNS resolution.


New feature: Before work, take some time to think carefully about this summary and research sites that showcase openAPI code generation and related best practices. Work hard to create a pioneering, performant design and leverage the existing codebase. Make sure to rebuild any files that need to be updated and implement this as a plugin architecture. The security aspects of this request are crucial, so ensure you thoroughly use the security testing to ensure the decentralized network is always checking for attacks or denial-of-service attacks from hackers. Research the hacker attacks and code around them using Cloudflare and other counter-black-hat methods to attack the network.

Implement a new plugin called /private/plugin/modules/OpenAPI wizard. This core module accepts plugin JSON configuration, which may be empty, contain an optional URL, or include an optional openAPI JSON body. A URL or JSON body is required for processing. If a URL is provided, it’s downloaded, validated as a valid OPENAPI 2.0 file, and processed accordingly. If a JSON body is provided, its structure is verified as a valid OPENAPI specification body, and processed accordingly. The system thoroughly audits the OPENAPI file to extract authentication information, name, and other relevant details for constructing the final JSON configuration. Using the JSON plugin specification, the tool finalizes the configuration with a default cost of 1 token and adheres to the per-use model or the information provided when the function is called. Ensure the authentication information is present in the JSON configuration. If not, the plugin incorporates functions to authenticate and authorize remote API use. These startup functions raise errors as per the plugin class. In most cases, authentication is required according to the OPENAPI specification, and the plugin generator generates the necessary code to comply. Call a test authentication method to verify the OPENAPI endpoint is ready for specified methods. Create a wrapper function for the plugin class that calls the OPENAPI methods. Use ZOD for type-safe data handling and raise errors when function calls don’t meet ZOD type-safe requirements throughout the codebase. Regularly perform penetration testing and related security checks when the OPENAPI client connects to the remote endpoint. If there are issues, stop the plugin and set it to active:false. Send a message to the network to shut down the plugin across all decentralized cores. Send a message to the supercore administrator to review the error and remove Docker or Rodman instances using this functionality by removing images from the cores. Ensure each function of the OPENAPI endpoint contract is ready. If only a single function is contracted, the token cost is based on the rate per function. If all methods are contracted, the token cost is 1xtotal functions defined in the OPENAPI specification.
