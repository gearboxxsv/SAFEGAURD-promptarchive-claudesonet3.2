Private/plugins/modules/pentest

Network security in the source code is robust for FIPS and zero trust, but the nodes are exposed to the internet and each other. Traffic is controlled using SSH and autossh with Cloudflare for egress and ingress. Users encapsulate risks by building plugin code inside Docker in Docker or QEMU/Lima virtual machines. This approach locks in the codebase but also runs unknown codebases. The system monitors traffic at router cores to ensure adherence to rules or standards.

We’ll use a Snort-based plugin architecture with a self-building Docker image. The plugin starts, stops, restarts, and logs data to a specific collection. It leverages the server core code’s monitoring framework to push updates and raise alerts. The plugin is initiated by a call to the first plugin class init and runs on a schedule. This cron-like aspect allows the tool to perform level actions, such as hourly checks on Nmap and plugin logs, to monthly penetration testing and pressure testing. This automated process requires updating Snort rules or other rules associated with listed tools.

The suite includes the ‘pentest’ plugin, which enables moderated testing of remote cores or supercores. It uses the message control protocol to request other cores to run tests on themselves, push critical alerts and detailed issue logs through the monitoring framework, and expose compromised cores to self-heal or assist with follow-up testing. These queued actions are handled using the penitent collection, which adheres to the Zod model standard for type safety.

Consider the request, read the article links, and review the code bases. Do we need to compile a source code from a link into a Docker container? Can we utilize weekly or monthly updates of Snort rules? Can we set standard ports for daily service and application testing? How can we innovate and address the risk posed by a large, decentralized network of cores? How can we reduce risk and enhance security from rogue or poorly coded practices? How can we update and stay informed about emerging threats? How can we incorporate plug-and-play features into the architecture?

Develop and present a comprehensive plan. Implement all the code. Ensure that features are not left with incomplete or poorly thought-out solutions.

Verify that the full requirements for the model context protocol, message communication protocol, agent to agent protocol, meteor RPC, and HTTP/2 JSONRPC are incorporated into the codebase. Create a new page for the /docs/monitoring section of the help files. Update the /docs/index.html with the navigation for this feature.

Analyze the .iso files for pen testing and review the documentation to determine if they constitute a suitable additional turn-key architecture. (Reference: NST 42-14476 Release Notes)

Usage Information

For more information on getting started with and using the NST, refer to the NST Wiki (http://wiki.networksecuritytoolkit.org/).

Network Security Toolkit (NST) is a bootable ISO image (Live USB Flash Drive) based on Fedora 42. It provides easy access to best-of-breed Open Source Network Security Applications and should run on most x86_64 systems.

The primary goal of developing this toolkit was to offer security professionals and network administrators a comprehensive set of Open Source Network Security Tools. The majority of the tools listed in the article “Top 125 Security Tools by INSECURE.ORG” are available in the toolkit. It features an advanced Web User Interface (WUI) for system/network administration, navigation, automation, network monitoring, host geolocation, network analysis, and configuration of numerous network and security applications within the NST distribution. In the virtual environment, NST can be utilized as a network security analysis, validation, and monitoring tool on enterprise virtual servers hosting virtual machines.

Features:

- Multi-Tap Network Packet Capture
- Web-Based Network Security Tools Management
- Host/IPv4 Address Geolocation
- Network/System Monitoring
- Network Intrusion Detection
- Network Interface Bandwidth Monitor
- Web-based Snort IDS Integration
- Active Connections Monitor
- Network Segment ARP Scanner
- Network Packet Capture CloudShark Upload Support
- Multi-Port Terminal Server
- VNC / RDP Desktop Session Management

Key implementation feature is that cores to self-heal or assist with follow-up testing. These queued actions are handled using the penitent collection, which adheres to the Zod model standard for type safety.

Damemonlogger implementation @ref:https://github.com/Cisco-Talos/Daemonlogger.git Daemonlogger™ is a packet logger and soft tap developed by Martin Roesch. The libpcap-based program has two runtime modes:
It sniffs packets and spools them straight to the disk and can daemonize itself for background packet logging. By default the file rolls over when 2 GB of data is logged.
It sniffs packets and rewrites them to a second interface, essentially acting as a soft tap. It can also do this in daemon mode.
These two runtime modes are mutually exclusive, if the program is placed in tap mode (using the -I switch) then logging to disk is disabled.
Make SURE you read the included COPYING file so that you understand how this file is licensed by Cisco, even though it's under the GPL v2 there are some clarifications that we have made regarding the licensing of this program.

Nmap @ref:https://nmap.org/book/man.html
One of Nmap's most exciting new features is the Nmap Scripting Engine, which extends Nmap's functionality using the simple and efficient Lua programming language. Nmap includes about 50 valuable scripts for network discovery and vulnerability detection, and you can also write your own. We describe the system in depth (from simple usage instructions to writing your own scripts) in our NSE guide. We also have an NSE Documentation Portal which includes detailed documentation for every NSE script and library. @ref:https://nmap.org/book/nse.html

Network discovery is Nmap’s core function, enabling tasks like querying Whois data, accessing ARIN, RIPE, or APNIC to determine IP address ownership, performing identd lookups, SNMP queries, and listing available NFS, SMB, and RPC shares and services.

Nmap’s version detection system (Chapter 7, Service and Application Version Detection) can recognize thousands of services using probe and regular expression signature-based matching, but it has limitations, such as requiring two independent probes for identifying Skype v2. NSE can handle these tasks and defaults to it for challenging services.

Vulnerability detection is crucial to quickly scan networks and identify vulnerable systems before malicious actors exploit them. While Nmap isn’t a comprehensive scanner, NSE can handle demanding checks. For instance, Nmap’s developers created the ssl-heartbleed detection script within two days after the Heartbleed bug affected hundreds of thousands of systems. Many vulnerability detection scripts are available, and Nmap plans to distribute more.

Backdoor detection is another capability of Nmap.
Many attackers and some automated worms leave backdoors for later reentry. Nmap’s regular expression-based version detection can detect some backdoors, but more complex ones require NSE’s advanced capabilities for reliable detection. NSE has detected the Double Pulsar NSA backdoor in SMB and backdoored versions of UnrealIRCd, vsftpd, and ProFTPd.

NSE, a general scripting language, can also exploit vulnerabilities. This capability may be valuable for penetration testers, but we don’t plan to turn Nmap into an exploitation framework like Metasploit.


Consider the request, read the article links, and review the code bases. Do we need to compile a source code from a link into a Docker container? Can we utilize weekly or monthly updates of Snort rules? Can we set standard ports for daily service and application testing? How can we innovate and address the risk posed by a large, decentralized network of cores? How can we reduce risk and enhance security from rogue or poorly coded practices? How can we update and stay informed about emerging threats? How can we incorporate plug-and-play features into the architecture?

Develop and present a comprehensive plan. Implement all the code. Ensure that features are not left with incomplete or poorly thought-out solutions.

Verify that the full requirements for the model context protocol, message communication protocol, agent to agent protocol, meteor RPC, and HTTP/2 JSONRPC are incorporated into the codebase. Create a new page for the /docs/monitoring section of the help files. Update the /docs/index.html with the navigation for this feature.

Analyze the .iso files for pen testing and review the documentation to determine if they constitute a suitable additional turn-key architecture. (Reference: NST 42-14476 Release Notes)
