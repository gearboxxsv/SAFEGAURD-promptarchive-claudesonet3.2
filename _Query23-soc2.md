Consider all these files about SOC2 compliance.  The reports are a format that is consistent with what a CIO would need to see regularly.  We need to have a plugin that create webpages from EJS formatted files.  These files are stored and served from mongodb.  The routes are for each report file listed here.  Setup a completed plugin that uses a template in bootstrap4 rules and design, that incorporates all the security, auditing, scanning, malware or rootlet, health check and SOC 2 topics into a set of routes served from the plugin.

Consider if there needs to updates to the recent security scanner plugin to meet these requirements.  If so then recode it or any other modules.

Take time to plan, work hard to examine the goals of a dashboard for security, and implement the solution with the following design goals:

SOC 2 trust principles?
Trust principles were established by the AICPA in 2016 to evaluate and report on an organization’s relevant controls for information and systems in order to assess their SOC 2 compliance.
In the 2016 Trust Services Principles and Criteria (TSPC) document, the AICPA specified five main principles:
Security
Availability
Processing integrity
Confidentiality
Privacy 

trust principles for SOC 2 audit
SOC 2 compliance is unique to each organization. Because of this, there’s no one-size-fits-all formula for selecting the trust services principles for a SOC 2 examination. The choice should be based on several factors, including:
the services you provide
user entity demands
contractual obligations
legal requirements
type of data within your system
According to the AICPA, the trust principles you select must be suitable. It defines the attributes of suitable as follows.
Relevance. The criteria should be admissible to the subject matter.
Objectivity. It should also be free from bias.
Measurability. It should allow consistent measurements — quantitative or qualitative — of subject matter.
Completeness. Criteria shouldn’t disregard relevant factors that could influence the decision-making process of intended users

SOC 2 Common Criteria list, also known as the CC-series, includes nine subcategories:
CC1 — Control environment Does the organization value integrity and security?
CC2 — Communication and Information Are policies and procedures in place to ensure security? Are they communicated well to both internal and external partners?
CC3 — Risk Assessment Does the organization analyze risk and monitor how changes impact that risk?
CC4 — Monitoring Controls Does the organization monitor, evaluate, and communicate the effectiveness of its controls?
CC5 — Control Activities Are the proper controls, processes, and technologies in place to reduce risk?
CC6 – Logical and Physical Access Controls Does the organization encrypt data? Does it control who can access data and restrict physical access to servers?
CC7 – System Operations Are systems monitored to ensure they function properly? Are incident response and disaster recovery plans in place?
CC8 – Change Management Are material changes to systems properly tested and approved beforehand?
CC9 – Risk Mitigation Does the organization mitigate risk through proper business processes and vendor management?
